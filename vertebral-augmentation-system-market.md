<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertebral Augmentation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Kyphoplasty</li><li>Vertebroplasty</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vertebral Augmentation System market is primarily categorized into three types: kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, and others. Kyphoplasty involves the insertion of a balloon to create space in the vertebra before cement is injected, helping restore height and reduce pain. Vertebroplasty directly injects cement into fractured vertebrae to provide stabilization. The "others" category encompasses emerging techniques or devices that may not fit neatly into the first two classifications, reflecting ongoing advancements in spinal treatment options.</p></p>
