<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Oncology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)</li><li>Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiation oncology market is primarily divided into two types: External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and Brachytherapy. EBRT involves delivering high-energy radiation beams from outside the body to target tumors, utilizing advanced technology for precise treatment. Brachytherapy, on the other hand, involves placing radioactive material directly inside or near the tumor, allowing for localized treatment with minimal impact on surrounding tissues. Both modalities are essential for effective cancer management, offering tailored approaches based on tumor type and patient needs.</p></p>
