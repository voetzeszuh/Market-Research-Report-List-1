<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smartphone 3D Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Binocular Stereo Vision</li><li>Time of Flight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smartphone 3D cameras market is primarily categorized into two types: Binocular Stereo Vision and Time of Flight (ToF). Binocular Stereo Vision uses two lenses to capture images from slightly different angles, creating depth perception by mimicking human eyesight. In contrast, Time of Flight technology measures the time it takes for light to reflect off objects and return to the sensor, allowing for precise depth mapping. Both technologies enhance augmented reality, photography, and user interaction in smartphones.</p></p>
