<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTP Servers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Clock</li><li>Boundary Clock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTP (Precision Time Protocol) server market comprises two primary types: Ordinary Clocks and Boundary Clocks. Ordinary Clocks serve as standalone time sources, synchronizing their internal clocks with a master clock to maintain precise time. In contrast, Boundary Clocks function as intermediaries, receiving time updates from a master and redistributing synchronized time to connected devices. This distinction enables Boundary Clocks to efficiently manage time across large networks, minimizing timing delays and ensuring that all devices remain accurately synchronized in complex systems.</p></p>
